AWS Profile Manager
======================

Think of this project like RVM but for managing Amazon profiles.

The biggest addition to this is that not only will it load stored
Amazon credentials into your shell as environment varables. But
the configurations are also encrypted at rest.

Installation
============

Clone this repo into: `$HOME/.awspm`

Add `$HOME/.awspm/bin` to your $PATH


Configuration
=============

Make sure you have openssl installed and in your PATH.

Usage
=====

```
awspm help
```
